# generate-includes-webpack-plugin

This is a plugin similar to html-webpack-plugin, but instead of injecting the imports on the HTML file it generates two files (head.pug and body.pug) to be included in your Pug layout

## Installation

To instal just run ```npm install generate-includes-webpack-plugin --save``` or ```yarn add generate-includes-webpack-plugin```
